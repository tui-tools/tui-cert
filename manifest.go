// Package tuicert exists for one reason: to embed the repository's tool.json
// into the binary.
//
// The manifest is the family's single source of truth about a tool. Since it
// also carries the `backends[]` block — which version of each optional program
// is the minimum, which ones have been tested, what changes on the old ones —
// the running binary reads it too, and no version number has to be written
// into the code. go:embed cannot reach outside its own package directory, so
// the embedding package is the module root.

// ManifestJSON is the repository's tool.json. Pass it to
